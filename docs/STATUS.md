# Status

Updated: 2026-09-06

## Done
- Stage 0: scope locked (docs/SCOPE.md, tidestep/config.py). Station =
  Kings Point 8516945, bbox = Manhasset Bay, 24h hourly, still-water ponding.
- Stage 1 (code): `tidestep/coops.py` (NYOFS + predictions + datums, hourly
  max, MLLW->NAVD88), `tidestep/dem.py` (3DEP ImageServer bbox export, tiled
  + merged), `tidestep/streets.py` (osmnx road graph + OSM water features).
  `scripts/fetch_all.py` runs all of it. Unit tests in `tests/` pass.

- Stage 1 (data): water levels fetched on the laptop (24 rows, NYOFS peak
  1.59 m NAVD88 on 2026-09-07 00Z, just under NWS minor 1.77 m).
- Stages 2-3 (code): `tidestep/segments.py` (15 m segments, min DEM
  elevation + its pixel), `tidestep/floodfill.py` (seed mask from
  nodata/MLLW/OSM water, scipy.ndimage.label connectivity, bathtub kept for
  comparison), `tidestep/hazard.py` (depth, inlet factor, per-profile safe
  flags). `scripts/build_hazard.py` runs them. Synthetic-terrain tests pass,
  including the cut-off-basin case the bathtub model gets wrong.

- Stages 2-3 (data): `scripts/build_hazard.py` ran on the real DEM
  (3913 x 4214 px, 1 m) and street graph (770 nodes / 1944 edges -> 5830
  segments) in 18 s. At the 2026-09-07 00Z peak (1.59 m NAVD88) 60 segments
  flood, all waterfront footways/paths (Manhasset Bay Walk etc.), no roads
  — consistent with the level being below NWS minor stage (1.77 m).
  Seed rule changed from MLLW to `SEED_ELEVATION_M = -1.0` because 3DEP
  hydro-flattens the bay at about -1.1 m NAVD88 (see config.py).

- OFS bias check (2026-09-06, last 48 h): obs were +0.38 m above
  predictions (real non-tidal water), OFS was +0.26 m above obs. So the
  0.4-1.1 m OFS-minus-predictions gap was part weather, part model bias.
  `fetch_forecast_frame` now subtracts the trailing 48 h mean OFS-obs bias
  (columns ofs_raw_m / ofs_bias_m / ofs_navd88_m in water_levels.csv).

- Stages 4-8 (code, tested end to end against a local PostGIS in Claude's
  sandbox with the real Sept 6 data): `docker-compose.yml` + `tidestep/db.py`
  (schema, loaders, GeoJSON + unsafe-edge queries, saved routes),
  `tidestep/api.py` (FastAPI: /api/hours, /api/risk, /api/route,
  /api/routes), `tidestep/routing.py` (Dijkstra with unsafe edges removed,
  vehicle profiles snap to drivable nodes, baseline comparison),
  `frontend/index.html` (Leaflet, hour slider with play button, click-to-
  route, per-profile colouring; Leaflet vendored so the demo works offline),
  `scripts/hourly_update.py` (fetch -> hazard -> PostGIS -> saved-route
  check -> email/log alert). 10 unit tests pass.

## Bug found and fixed: study area
The first bbox left the Kings Point gauge outside and, because the two
shores of Manhasset Bay only connect by road south of the box, osmnx's
default largest-component filter silently dropped the entire west shore
(graph had nodes only between lon -73.711 and -73.700). Fixed:
`BBOX = (40.795, -73.775, 40.845, -73.695)` and `retain_all=True`.
**data/ must be regenerated**: delete `data/dem_1m.tif`,
`data/streets.graphml`, `data/water.gpkg`, `data/segments.gpkg`, then run
fetch_all -> build_hazard -> load_db again. DEM will be ~4x larger
(about 150 MB); build_hazard should take about a minute.

## Next
- Regenerate data with the new bbox (above), then run the app and record
  the slider demo footage.
- Stage 9: validation against past high-tide flooding days.
- Stage 10: limitations write-up (docs/LIMITATIONS.md).
- `data/water.gpkg` (OSM water features) had not downloaded yet when
  build_hazard ran, so near_inlet is all False. Re-run once it exists.
- Stage 4-5: PostGIS schema + FastAPI endpoints.

## Notes
- `ofs_water_level` returns 6-minute data; we take the hourly max.
- CO-OPS gaps come back as empty strings; `_to_series` drops them.
